Buying a stronger whip.\r\n\r\n2. Changing riders.\r\n\r\n3. Threatening the horse with termination.\r\n\r\n4. Appointing a committee to study the horse.\r\n\r\n5.

Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.\r\n\r\n8. Change the form so that it reads: \"This horse is not dead.\"\r\n\r\n9. Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.\r\n\r\n10. Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.\r\n\r\n11. Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby\r\n\r\ndeducting its full original cost.\r\n\r\n12. Provide additional funding to increase the horse's performance.\r\n\r\n13. Do a time management study to see if lighter riders would improve productivity.\r\n\r\n14. Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs better.\r\n\r\n15. Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.",
